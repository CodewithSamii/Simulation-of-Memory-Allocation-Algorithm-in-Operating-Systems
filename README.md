# Simulation-of-Memory-Allocation-Algorithm-in-Operating-Systems
A console-based C project that simulates memory allocation strategies: First Fit, Best Fit, and Worst Fit. It uses minimal and efficient code to visualize how processes are allocated in memory, helping understand core OS memory management concepts.
